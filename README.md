Surfs Up!

## **Overview**
The purpose of this project was to collect data for a potential viability in an investment in a surf shop in Oahu for W. Avy. We look at weather and preciptation data for the months of June and December by parsing data from a SQLite file.

## **Results**

###### **June Results**
  - June had 1700 counts of data with an average temperature of 75 degrees Farhenheit.
  - The minimum temperature was 64 degrees and the maximum was 85 degrees.

###### **December Results**
  - December had 1517 counts of data with an average temperature of 71 degrees Farhenheit.
  - The minimum temperature was 56 degrees and the maximum was 83 degrees.

## Summary
  I generated a couple Histograms for the two months for further depth for this analysis. While December sees lower overnight temperatures, the weather is otherwise very similar in the day. There isn't a whole lot of variance in temperature which tells us that the temperature is quite stable and warm year round. I would advise W. Avy that this dream of a combo Surf/Ice Cream shop is a good investment opporunity.
